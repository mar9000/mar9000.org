      <h2>Site organization</h1>
      <p>When you start crating a web site the nightmare of the software selection begins. I usually do not like fancy CMS where you don't know what happens when a new post is created. For a long time I look at the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/index.html">Martin Folwer <em>bliki</em></a> but <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> seemed to me something I should give a chance. This site started to host my personal pages and the translation to italian of a <a href="http://elblogdejeronimo.wordpress.com/">blog written in spanish from Cuba</a>.</p>
      <p>At the end I decided to use plain files (Bootstrap+PHP) for my personal pages and WordPress for the blog I was going to translate so I could try both solutions. After some contents will be added I probably would like to look at some template engine.</p>
      <p>Quoting Martin Fowler: <em>"I find writing too hard to want to spend it on things that disappear"</em>, content here are created in the hope that It did not age quickly.</p>
      <p>Missing: search, tags, index, RSS.</p>
