      <h2>Site organization</h1>
      <p>When you start crating a web site the nightmare of the software selection for it begin. I usually do not like fancy CMS where you don't know what happens when a new post is created. For a long time I look at the Martin Folwer site but WordPress seemed to me something I should give a try. This site started to host my personal pages and the translation to italian of a spanish blog from Cuba.</p>
    <p>At the end I decided to use plain html (bootstrap) for my personal pages and WordPress for the blog I was going to translate this because the spanish blog is build with WordPress itself.
