      <p>There was a time where I was far away from home and I had to face everything alone. In those days these words helped to don't get lost and keep following my rough and narrow path.</p>
      <h2>Ithaca</h2>
      <small>
	<p>
	  When you set out on your journey to Ithaca,<br/>
	  pray that the road is long,<br/>
	  full of adventure, full of knowledge.<br/>
	  The Lestrygonians and the Cyclops,<br/>
	  the angry Poseidon -- do not fear them:<br/>
	  You will never find such as these on your path,<br/>
	  if your thoughts remain lofty, if a fine<br/>
	  emotion touches your spirit and your body.<br/>
	  The Lestrygonians and the Cyclops,<br/>
	  the fierce Poseidon you will never encounter,<br/>
	  if you do not carry them within your soul,<br/>
	  if your soul does not set them up before you.<br/>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Pray that the road is long.<br/>
	  That the summer mornings are many, when,<br/>
	  with such pleasure, with such joy<br/>
	  you will enter ports seen for the first time;<br/>
	  stop at Phoenician markets,<br/>
	  and purchase fine merchandise,<br/>
	  mother-of-pearl and coral, amber and ebony,<br/>
	  and sensual perfumes of all kinds,<br/>
	  as many sensual perfumes as you can;<br/>
	  visit many Egyptian cities,<br/>
	  to learn and learn from scholars.<br/>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Always keep Ithaca in your mind.<br/>
	  To arrive there is your ultimate goal.<br/>
	  But do not hurry the voyage at all.<br/>
	  It is better to let it last for many years;<br/>
	  and to anchor at the island when you are old,<br/>
	  rich with all you have gained on the way,<br/>
	  not expecting that Ithaca will offer you riches.<br/>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Ithaca has given you the beautiful voyage.<br/>
	  Without her you would have never set out on the road.<br/>
	  She has nothing more to give you.<br/>
	</p>
	<p>
	  And if you find her poor, Ithaca has not deceived you.<br/>
	  Wise as you have become, with so much experience,<br/>
	  you must already have understood what Ithacas mean.<br/>
	</p>
