      <p>Basically I'm an IT engineer, graduated in Pisa (Italy), aim to develop OpenSource software. My knowledge come mainly from business process analysis and software development activities to implementing them.</p>
      <p>In addition I have many interests not strictly related with computer science as you will see on this site.</p>
      <p>Philosophy, traveling and learning new languages and ways of life are some of them, I'm studing russian at the moment.</p>
      <p>Creating things by myself instead of buying them it's something I never will do enough, not because of the money you can save but rather because of the knowledge and culture you can learn by doing this.</p>
      <p>Socially I'm probably partially defined by this quote from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvrRF6un-NU">Caro diario</a> e movie by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanni_Moretti">Nanni Moretti</a>:
	<em>You know what I was thinking? I was thinking a very sad thing. Even in a more decent society than this one, I'll only feel at ease with a minority of people, but not like in those films where a couple fights on a desert island because the filmmaker doesn't believe in people, I believe in people I just don't believe in the majority of people, so I think I'll always be in tune with a minority.</em><br/>
	But I don't think it's a sad thing.</p>
