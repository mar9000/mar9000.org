      <p>Basically I'm an IT engineer, graduated in Pisa (Italy), aim to develop OpenSource software. My knowledge come mainly from business process analysis and software development to implementing them.</p>
      <p>In addition I have may interests not strictly related with computer science as you will see on this site.</p>
      <p>Philosofy, traveling and learning new languages are some of them, I'm studing russian at the moment.</p>
      <p>Creating things by myself instead of buying them it's something I never will do enough, not because of the money you can save but rather because of the culture you can learn from doing this.</p>
